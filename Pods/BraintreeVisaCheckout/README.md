# Braintree iOS Visa Checkout SDK

Welcome to Braintree's iOS Visa Checkout SDK. This library will help you accept Visa Checkout payments in your iOS app.

**The Braintree iOS Visa Checkout SDK is currently in a limited release and the API is subject to change.**

**The Braintree iOS Visa Checkout SDK requires Xcode 9.2, Base SDK of iOS 9.0+, and Visa Checkout SDK for iOS v6.6.0**. It permits a Deployment Target of iOS 9.0 or higher.

## Getting Started

We recommend using [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) to integrate the Braintree iOS Visa Checkout SDK with your project.

The Visa Checkout iOS SDK is also required, and available through this repository. Reference the [Visa Checkout](#visa-checkout) section for details on accessing the Visa Checkout iOS SDK.

### CocoaPods

Add to your `Podfile`:
```
pod 'BraintreeVisaCheckout'
```
Then run `pod install`. This includes everything you need to accept Visa Checkout payments.

Customize your integration by specifying additional components. For example, to add Apple Pay support:
```
pod 'BraintreeVisaCheckout'
pod 'Braintree/Apple-Pay'
```

See our [`Podspec`](Braintree.podspec) for more information.
